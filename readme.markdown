Pretty early days, lots of bugs and the options aren't working correctly yet. Would like this to be a bit more bare-boned, configurable and finally allow the user to style with CSS as much as possible.

# Bugs

1. name change (get rid of gcarousel)
2. first-child hiding the <li> elements, what browsers does this support?
3. sort out automating the width of the container element (so it can just be slotted into a page)
4. height / width options don't seem to be working properly
5. test in IE and other browsers...
6. multiple clicks... kind of messes it up (don't allow anything until animation is done or do animation quicker)
7. down arrow, getting a mini flash from prepending img after animation... fix.
8. test all options, looks like they are breaking right now
